### First Version without UI 

Here is my 2022 version of Rock Paper Scissors.

I made a version in 2021. This year I got back to The Odin Project with full dedication, dove deeper into the topics and decided to start over the full curriculum from scratch. 

Compared to last year, this project felt so much more comfortable. 

This project/exercise focuses mostly on declaring and calling upon functions, using conditionals and loops. 

I tried to keep the code readable enough to speak for itself without comments. 

If I'd change anything, it'd be my pseudocode. I realized that since I already knew this project, I started considering programming solutions and put them in the pseudocode. It went naturally but that could potentially limit keeping an open mind for solutions in projects I see for the first time coming up. 

### Second Version including Basic UI

I went for a very basic UI since I feel the main objective was putting into practice some DOM manipulation. 

I also changed some of the code to make it work. I added a function for updating textContent based on feedback, and in the future I might consider that function to take an array of multiple values so it can updateTextContent on multiple sections at a time. 

For now I learned a lot more about DOM manipulation and feel more confident about having a basic understanding of it to apply to the coming projects. 

### Possible Features to add if I ever get back to this in the future

- [ ] A more fancy UI, possibly including images
- [ ] Updated `updateTextContent` function
- [ ] Round counter to make it more obvious when two rounds in a row tie with the same selection as the previous round. 
- [x] An quick fade out and fade in to achieve the above
