Here is my 2022 version of Rock Paper Scissors.

I made a version in 2021. This year I got back to The Odin Project with full dedication, dove deeper into the topics and decided to start over the full curriculum from scratch. 

Compared to last year, this project felt so much more comfortable. 

This project/exercise focuses mostly on declaring and calling upon functions, using conditionals and loops. 

I tried to keep the code readable enough to speak for itself without comments. 

If I'd change anything, it'd be my pseudocode. I realized that since I already knew this project, I started considering programming solutions and put them in the pseudocode. It went naturally but that could potentially limit keeping an open mind for solutions in projects I see for the first time coming up.
