1. We need a player choice (preferably prompt)
- playerchoice has to be rock paper or scissors
- playerchoice has to be made lowercase

2. We need a computer choice picked randomly out of three options

3. if else for different options:
- computer & player equal = tie
- computer wins: Rock vs scissors, Paper vs Rock, Scissors vs Paper.
- else: player wins.

4. add points for computer or player depending on who won.

5. play a game (write a function for it) with player and computerchoice, check point 3, return a message to the console who won.

6. Make a function to play the function in point 5, 5 times (5 rounds) and then decide a winner
- use a for loop for this
- console.log the winner out of 5 games.
